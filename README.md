<h1> Python: 100 days of coding Day 3</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
  Learn about Conditional Statements, Logical Operators, Code Blocks, and Scope. At the end of today, I will create a choose-your-own-adventure game to utilize these new tools.<br />
<br />

<h3>Task 1:</h3>
Write a program that works out whether a given number is an odd or even number: 
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="left"> This uses Modulo to test whether a given number input is even or odd.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>Task 2:</h3> 
BMI Calculator 2.0. Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height:
<br /> 
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/exYuftN.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="BMI2.0"/>
</p>
<p align="left"> These are the parameters for determining the output printed statement based on the BMI.
<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sPnsZ48.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="BMI2.0 output"/>
</p>
<p align="left"> This code uses conditional statements to print out the input BMI number and their health level.<br/>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<h3>Task 3:</h3>
Write a program that works out whether a given year is a leap year.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Fly3kxb.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="leap"/>
</p>
<p align="left"> This code uses nested conditional statements to determine if the input year is a leap year or not.<br/>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>Task 4:</h3>
Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza! Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program. Based on a user's order, work out their final bill. </br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7Ls5XkW.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="pizza"/>
</p>
<p align="left"> These are the parameters for building and pricing your pizza.<br/>
<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/k0mF6VZ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="total bill"/>
</p>
<p align="left"> This is my code to calculate the pizza price based on the given inputs.<br/>
<br />
<br />  
<br />
<h3>Task 5:</h3>
Write a program that tests the compatibility between two people based on their names:</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zlp80YQ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="love score"/>
</p>
<p align="left"> This was the task.<br/>
<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2Y68VaH.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="love score code"/>
</p>
<p align="left"> This was a tricky task. I combined counting and swapping between integers and strings to write this program.<br/>
<br />
<br />  
<br />
<h3>Task 6:</h3>
Create a choose-your-own-adventure game to utilize these new tools:</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AZdcQWx.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="logic map"/>
</p>
<p align="left"> This is the logic map used to create my game.<br/>
<br />  
<br />
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/99slKnf.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="code"/>
</p>
<p align="left"> This was the outcome. Creating this game was a lot of fun and brought me back to my childhood :D<br/>
<br />
<br />
<p align="left"> That's all for Day 3!
